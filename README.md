Predictive Modeling using the data provided by DonorsChoose

This repo contains some basic EDA and modeling based on the data provided by DonorsChoose, an organization that provides infrastructure allowing school teachers to fund projects using crowd sourcing from donors all over the world. 

The data, which consists of a number of tables, was obtained from:
http://data.donorschoose.org

Within the tables are basic information about projects, the resources requested in each of the projects and the various donors as well as their contribution amount.

The purpose of this project is to gain insight that would hopefully allow future teachers to structure their proposal in a manner that would help them get funded. Future exploration of the data will allow us to better understand the general audience of the site, the donors, whose generosity makes these projects possible.
